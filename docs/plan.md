# MCL — Implementation Plan

> **Active work only.** Completed and superseded work is in
> [plan_completed.md](plan_completed.md); deferred candidates and external conditions are in
> [backlog.md](backlog.md). Neither is part of the current plan.

## Now (2026-09-26)

| | |
|---|---|
| **NEXT STEP** | Move the API into `forge-platform` — [task file](phases/repository-extraction-forge-platform.md). |

## Active phases

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [Repository extraction — Platform](phases/repository-extraction.md) | Split this repo into single-purpose repos. Move code only — no redesign. | Active: `forge-platform` in progress. |
| [Phase 46 — domain-ownership remediation](phases/phase-46-domain-ownership-remediation.md) | Establish a repository-wide ownership inventory and remove confirmed duplicate, overlapping, and mission-specific runtime implementations through Codex-supervised work. | Core, hands, generic Worker, and hosted terminal-result remediation accepted; remaining default-path and compatibility cleanup depend on the Phase 45 integration chain. |

## Design docs
