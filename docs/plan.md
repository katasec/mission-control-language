# MCL — Implementation Plan

> **Active work only.** Completed and superseded work is in
> [plan_completed.md](plan_completed.md); deferred candidates and external conditions are in
> [backlog.md](backlog.md). Neither is part of the current plan.

## Now (2026-09-08)

| | |
|---|---|
| **NEXT STEP** | Use the approved [Mission chat experience v1](design/mission-chat-experience-v1.md) as the next static Presentation-only design slice; backend integration remains deferred until the experience is reviewed. |

## Active phases

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [Phase 45 — Forge Desktop mission conversations](phases/phase-45-mission-conversations.md) | Evolve the existing Desktop Project workspace from one-shot Mission runs into version-pinned, durable Mission Conversations with in-Explorer authoring and evaluation. | Authoring, evaluation, publication, and pinned-conversation launch are accepted; Mission chat experience direction is captured, with integration deferred pending UI review. |
| [Phase 46 — domain-ownership remediation](phases/phase-46-domain-ownership-remediation.md) | Establish a repository-wide ownership inventory and remove confirmed duplicate, overlapping, and mission-specific runtime implementations through Codex-supervised work. | Core, hands, generic Worker, and hosted terminal-result remediation accepted; remaining default-path and compatibility cleanup depend on the Phase 45 integration chain. |
