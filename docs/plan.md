# MCL — Implementation Plan

> **Active work only.** Completed and superseded work is in
> [plan_completed.md](plan_completed.md); deferred candidates and external conditions are in
> [backlog.md](backlog.md). Neither is part of the current plan.

## Now (2026-09-12)

| | |
|---|---|
| **NEXT STEP** | Review Claude's bounded [Phase 48 Mission Chat live integration](phases/phase-48-mission-chat-live-integration.md) implementation and evidence against the locked UI and default-path acceptance. |

## Active phases

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [Phase 45 — Forge Desktop mission conversations](phases/phase-45-mission-conversations.md) | Evolve the existing Desktop Project workspace from one-shot Mission runs into version-pinned, durable Mission Conversations with in-Explorer authoring and evaluation. | Authoring, evaluation, publication, and pinned-conversation launch are accepted; Mission Chat integration is separately scoped in Phase 48. |
| [Phase 46 — domain-ownership remediation](phases/phase-46-domain-ownership-remediation.md) | Establish a repository-wide ownership inventory and remove confirmed duplicate, overlapping, and mission-specific runtime implementations through Codex-supervised work. | Core, hands, generic Worker, and hosted terminal-result remediation accepted; remaining default-path and compatibility cleanup depend on the Phase 45 integration chain. |
| [Phase 48 — Mission Chat live integration](phases/phase-48-mission-chat-live-integration.md) | Make the approved Mission Chat journey live using the existing Project and durable-conversation owners. | Implementation authorised; awaiting Claude's bounded implementation and evidence. |
