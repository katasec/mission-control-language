# MCL — Implementation Plan

> **Active work only.** Completed and superseded work is in
> [plan_completed.md](plan_completed.md); deferred candidates and external conditions are in
> [backlog.md](backlog.md). Neither is part of the current plan.

## Now (2026-09-26)

| | |
|---|---|
| **NEXT STEP** | Complete Phase 51's unchanged canonical Desktop workflow and downloaded-artifact acceptance. |

## Active phases

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [Phase 51 — Desktop publish-script extraction](phases/phase-51-desktop-publish-script.md) | Extract Desktop publishing, remove obsolete local projects, and preserve the canonical release bundle contract. | 🟡 Local build, removal, and transport checks verified; canonical workflow and artifact acceptance pending. |
| [Phase 46 — domain-ownership remediation](phases/phase-46-domain-ownership-remediation.md) | Establish a repository-wide ownership inventory and remove confirmed duplicate, overlapping, and mission-specific runtime implementations through Codex-supervised work. | ⏸ **On hold — review after the reorg before starting.** |
