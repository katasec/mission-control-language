# MCL — Implementation Plan

> **Active work only.** Completed and superseded work is in
> [plan_completed.md](plan_completed.md); deferred candidates and external conditions are in
> [backlog.md](backlog.md). Neither is part of the current plan.

## Now (2026-09-26)

| | |
|---|---|
| **NEXT STEP** | Phase 50.5: write the `forge-rooms` task file (same shape as [50.4](phases/phase-50.4-forge-platform.md)). |

## Active phases

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [Phase 50 — Repository extraction](phases/phase-50-repository-extraction.md) | Split this repo into single-purpose repos. Move code only — no redesign. | Active: `forge-platform` ✅; `forge-rooms` next. |
| [Phase 46 — domain-ownership remediation](phases/phase-46-domain-ownership-remediation.md) | Establish a repository-wide ownership inventory and remove confirmed duplicate, overlapping, and mission-specific runtime implementations through Codex-supervised work. | ⏸ **On hold until Phase 50 is complete.** Don't start work here; review after the reorg. |
